# Networking Factory

This module implements end-to-end creation processes for networking, including projects, VPCs, connectivity, routing, DNS and firewalls, leveraging a YAML syntax.

The factory is implemented as a thin data translation layer for the underlying modules, so that no "magic" or hidden side effects are implemented in code, and debugging or integration of new features are simple.
